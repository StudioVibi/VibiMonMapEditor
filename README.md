# VibiMon Map Editor

The **VibiMon Map Editor** lets you create maps visually for the VibiMon universe, which is built entirely using glyphs. This grid-based system recreates the classic tile-based movement feel, similar to Game Boy games.

## How it works

- Reads glyphs from `Glyph.ts`, where each glyph has markers for events, sprites, etc.
- Converts markers into interactive editing tools.
- Build maps visually and export them as text through **Raw View**.
- Supports **cross-platform play**, even in terminal environments.

> The sprites in demos are from **Pokémon Red** (© Nintendo / Game Freak / The Pokémon Company) and are temporary placeholders.
